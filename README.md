## Code Coverage Validation

### To see the backend code coverage percentage:

1.  Run the backend tests:
    ```bash
    cd item-service
    mvn clean test jacoco:report
    ```
2.  Open the coverage report in your browser:
    ```
    target/site/jacoco/index.html
    ```

Or, if you prefer, from the terminal on Mac:
` bash open target/site/jacoco/index.html  `
3\.  The report will show the total coverage percentage and the detail by class/package.

### To see the frontend code coverage percentage:

1.  Run the frontend tests:
    ```bash
    cd meli-item-frontend
    npm install
    npm run test
    ```
2.  Run the coverage report:
    ```
    npm run coverage
    ```

#### Or inside the frontend docker container
